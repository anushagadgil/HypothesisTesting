# HypothesisTesting
Performed Hypothesis Testing on a Wine Dataset
In this project, we explore the concept of hypothesis testing by working with a dataset and applying different statistical tests to draw meaningful insights. We will devise two null hypotheses based on different aspects of our data, and for each hypothesis, we will determine alpha levels, power levels, and minimum effect sizes. Additionally, we will perform hypothesis tests to validate our null hypotheses and create visualizations to help interpret the results.
